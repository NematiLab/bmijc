Welcome to the journal club for the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory University.

We present and critique literature on machine learning, signal processing, and computation in biomedicine.

In the future we may organize some workshops on data analysis techniques.

Attendees include graduate students, postdocs, and faculty from engineering, math/CS, informatics, and medicine.

Sessions are moderated by [Professor Shamim Nemati](http://scholar.harvard.edu/shamim/home).
